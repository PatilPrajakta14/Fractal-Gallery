# Fractal Visualizations

This project is a collection of fractal generators and visualizations built using HTML, JavaScript, and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Originally developed during my undergraduate studies, I've recently updated the project to modernize the design, improve user experience, and ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## Recent Updates

I've made some small but impactful changes to the project’s design and layout. These updates enhance the visual appeal and usability without altering the core functionality, reflecting my ongoing commitment to refining my work and keeping my portfolio up-to-date.

## Features

- **Mandelbrot Set:** An interactive visualization of the classic Mandelbrot fractal.
- **Koch Polygon:** A dynamic rendering of the Koch fractal.
- **N-Tree Fractal:** A naturalistic fractal tree that can regenerate with a click.
- **Koch Snowflake:** A visually appealing rendition of the Koch Snowflake.

- **index.html** – A landing page linking to each fractal example.
- **fractals/** – Contains the individual fractal pages with a consistent, modern design.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or run a local server (e.g., using VS Code Live Server or Python’s built-in HTTP server).
3. Click on any fractal link to view the visualization.

## Technology Used

- **HTML5** & **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **p5.js** for rendering the graphics

## About

This project was initially created during my undergraduate studies as an exploration of computer graphics and fractal algorithms. The recent updates not only improve its visual presentation but also demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and project enhancement.
